# MNIST Digit Recognizer [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ssorkhou/learning/HEAD?filepath=%2FMNIST%2FMNIST%20Digit%20Recognizer.ipynb)

This folder contains the Jupyter notebook in which I work on MNIST's digits dataset. I use two convolutional neural networks, one with an image data generator and one without, to recognize the digits in the dataset. As expected, the network using an image data generator performs better. Follow along via an interactive notebook hosted by Binder by clicking the "launch binder" button above.
