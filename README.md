# Learning
Here is where I will be keeping all the projects I worked on when starting my data science journey. These projects are *not* at all polished products. The purpose of this repository is simply for me to store all my old Jupyter notebooks in an easily accessible place for reference purposes.

If you have any suggestions/comments please feel free to let me know!
