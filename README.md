# Machine Learning Practice
Here is where I will be keeping the projects I worked on when starting my data science journey. These projects are *not* at all polished products. They primarily served an educational role and provided me with good practice in machine learning and data science. The purpose of this repository is simply for me to store my old Jupyter notebooks in an easily accessible place for reference purposes.
